# UKCP18-hydro-MIP

UKCP18 Hydrology Intercomparison Hackathon

UK climate and hydrology-focused hackathon in collaboration with CEH and the HydroJULES programme.
By Digital Futures
Date and time
July 14 · 9am - July 16 · 5pm GMT+1
Location
The University of Manchester
Oxford Road Manchester M13 9PL


Across the UK, an huge number of hydrological simulations have been carried out to understand how floods and droughts may change in the future. But to date, no coordinated intercomparison of these simulations exists. By comparing models, we can better understand the robustness of future river flow projections, identify uncertainties, and build a stronger, shared evidence base to support climate resilience planning.

Over three days, we will bring together researchers and practitioners from across the UK to conduct the first full intercomparison of hydrological model outputs run with UKCP18 climate projections. Whether you're contributing existing results or running new simulations, we welcome participation from any hydrological models, across any UK catchments.

Together, we will:

    Share insights and challenges in modelling future river flows
    Harmonise outputs into a shared format
    Define and calculate meaningful comparison metrics
    Create impactful, open-access intercomparison figures and analyses
    Explore how different models represent hydrological processes
    Publish open-source code for transparency and reuse
    Kick-start a collaborative journal paper on our findings

This is a unique opportunity to shape the national conversation on future water resources and extremes, strengthen your network, and co-author high-impact research.

Involvement includes: 1 day preparation, a 3-day workshop, and collaborative writing of a scientific paper.

Cost: Free (lunch and refreshments provided)

Location: University Place Room 6.208, The University of Manchester
